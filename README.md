### Project Overview

 Problem Statement
The data given is of the mutual funds in the USA. The objective of this problem is to predict the ‘basis point spread’ over AAA bonds i.e. feature ‘bonds_aaa’ against each Serial Number.
Basis Point Spread indicates the additional return a mutual fund would give over the AAA rated bonds.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project I have a better understanding of how to apply the linear model using GridsearchCV.

1. - Chi square contengency test
2. - Box plot
3. - Linear regression
4. - GridsearchCV
5. - Ridge and Lasso Regressor
